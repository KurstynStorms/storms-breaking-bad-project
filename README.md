# Breaking Bad Project

# Goal
This project will allow users to access all of the information regarding the characters from the television show Breaking Bad including their names, an image of them, their nickname and the actor who portrays them. There will also be a second area on the page in which the user can input a character's full name and it will generate a popular quote from said character.

# Inspiration
Breaking Bad was a show that I loved a lot while it was on air. It was also one of the only shows that my father thoroughly enjoyed so I felt that it would be very cool to have it be something he could interact with the next time I see him. It is a fun app for fans of the show to use to see characters they may not have remembered from the show.

# Instructions
Fork and clone the repository.
Open index.html in your terminal.
Explore the search features to find your favorite character or a quote from them.
Enjoy!
